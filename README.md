# Green & O'Dea et al (2022) scRNA sequencing data analysis
This repository contains R &amp; Python code for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data from Hammond et al. (2019) and Kracht et al. (2020) and generating figures for the Green &amp; O'Dea et al manuscript (in submission). 

Single-cell RNA sequencing data from Hammond et al. (2019) can be obtained from the NIH GEO database (GSE121654). Single-cell RNA-sequencing data from Zhong et al. (2018) can be obtained from the NIH GEO database (GSE104276). 

Requires R version â‰¥3.6. Python version 3.7 was used for generating stacked violin plots. See packages.txt file for required packages.
