# Green & O'Dea et al (2022) scRNA sequencing analysis
This repository contains R &amp; Python code for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data from Hammond et al. (2019) and Kracht et al. (2020) and generating figures for [Green &amp; O'Dea et al 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01091-9). 

Single-cell RNA sequencing data from Hammond et al. (2019) can be obtained from the NIH GEO database (GSE121654). Single-cell RNA-sequencing data from Zhong et al. (2018) can be obtained from the NIH GEO database (GSE104276). 

R version 4.1 was used for this analysis. Python version 3.7 was used for generating stacked violin plots. See packages.txt file for required packages.
